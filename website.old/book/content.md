# Structured Data on the Web

## About

Structured data on the web is a way to provide semantics and linked data in an approachable manner.  This approach expresses concepts in JSON-LD which is a JavaScript notation popular among developers which easily expresses  concepts (terms) and links to related resources (things).   This structured data on the web approach has been popularized by the large commercial search providers like Google, Bing, Yandex and others via schema.org  As described at schema.org: "Schema.org is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond."
The popularity of leveraging the schema.org approach in the earth sciences can be attributed to both this ease of developer adoption and also to its foundational use of web architecture. A web architecture foundation aids adoption by the operations side as well as the developer side.  It also takes advantage of the scale and resilience of the web.  
The broad nature of schema.org even scopes to the concepts of Datasets.  It is the existence of schema.org/Dataset that was a focus of several EarthCube projects (Project 418, Project 419 and the Resource Registry) from which spun up the ESIP Science on Schema work.  
Additionally, Google leveraged schema.org/Dataset to develop and populate the Google Data Set Search and provides guidance to developers to facilitate this.  

## Broader Impacts
By leveraging existing technology and approaches a larger community is enabled to engage and make more samples discoverable and usable.

The nature of structured data on the web also provides the ability to apply semantic context to samples.  This means richer discovery and information about samples, the past uses and potential future uses is more readily available.

Simplified architecture also means easier development of tools and interfaces to present the data.  Allowing the presentation of samples and their information in a manner aligned with a given community's needs.    A simplified architecture aids sustainability from both a technical and financial perspective.  

## Web architecture approach

Deep Schema is focused on leveraging the web architecture as the foundation for this approach.  There are several key reasons for this vs approaches like OAI-PMH or others.

A key point is that in the processes of establishing a web presence, a standard step for groups, they have already begun to build the infrastructure needed for structured data on the web.  Setting up special servers or establishing and maintaining special APIs to support harvesting is not required.  

Also, a large collection of tooling already exists around JSON that is directly usable in JSON-LD.  That scale extends to the use of schema.org patterns which have become common in the commercial web.  Allowing us to bring those same patterns and the tooling to the science community.

Additionally, this approach keeps the metadata and its representation a product of the data providers.  The actor in the life cycle most aware of needed edits, new records or other events.  That same record then serves multiple consumers able to generate various value add products.  This benefits the provider by facilitating multiple and varied discovery vectors for their holdings.  

Another key factor is the web native and semantic nature of this representation of metadata.  Traditional metadata, such as ISO, by itself does not express a web referenceable instance of concepts.  In doing this, structured data on the web allow connections to be made and discovered by people and machines across many holdings.  This aids in both serendipitous discovery and can also be leveraged to aid discovery via semantic relations.
